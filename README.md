# Data Science Project Portfolio

Welcome to my data science project portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of projects that I have undertaken to explore various aspects of data analysis, manipulation, and visualization using SQL and Python. As a student passionate about delving into the world of data science, I've embarked on these projects to deepen my understanding of real-world data challenges and hone my skills in tackling them effectively.

## Projects

### 1. [Uber Case Study](UberCaseStudy.pdf)
   Description: In Uber's pursuit of profit, a dynamic team, blending data science, product innovation, and marketing prowess, tackles Uber Pool's poor performance head-on. Their brainchild? Express Poolâ€”an inventive twist with wait time dynamics and pedestrian adventure.

### 2. [E-Commerce Retail Analysis](RetailAnalysis-SportsClothing.pdf)
   Description: In the expansive sports clothing industry valued at $193 billion, the project aimed to optimize the retail revenue of an online sports apparel company. Techniques such as aggregation, cleaning, labelling, and CTE were employed to derive actionable insights for enhancing revenue. Tools Used: SQL

These projects cover a range of topics and methodologies, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and more. Each project is accompanied by a Jupyter notebook detailing the data analysis process, from initial data exploration to model evaluation and interpretation.

Feel free to explore the projects and notebooks, and don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback. Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
